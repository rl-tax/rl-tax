\section{Solution Design}
A two-level deep reinforcement learning framework will be used, integrating the agents and planner's MDP.

\subsection{Inner Loop (Agents' Learning)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Agents interact in the environment and learn policies \( \pi_i \) using deep RL algorithms (e.g., PPO).
    \item Their objective is to maximize the expected discounted return based on their MDP, with rewards that reflect changes in utility (coins versus labor cost).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Outer Loop (Planner's Learning)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The planner observes an aggregate state \( s_p \) (wealth distribution, productivity, etc.) and sets a tax schedule \( a_p \) for the upcoming tax period.
    \item Its policy \( \pi_p \) is trained with deep RL methods to maximize improvements in social welfare:
    \[
    r_p = \text{swf}(s'_p) - \text{swf}(s_p).
    \]
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Interaction Dynamics}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Influence of Planner on Agents: The tax schedule (action \( a_p \)) directly affects agents’ rewards by modifying post-tax incomes.
    \item Influence of Agents on Planner: The agents’ adaptive responses under the new tax policy determine the next aggregate state \( s'_p \) that the planner observes.
\end{itemize}
