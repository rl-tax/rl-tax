\begin{abstract}
    In this project, we simulate the economic output, given a tax policy. This project is adapted from the work of \cite{zheng_2020_aieconomist}, where the model is comprises of two interconnected Markov Decision Process. The inner-loop MDP is the agents MDP, which have partial observations and interact to each other in a gather-and-build simulation. The outer-loop MDP models a social planner that find the optimal tax policy to maximize a social welfare function, which is formulated by a product of equality and economic productivity.
